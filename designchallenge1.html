			<strong>Which two websites are you most inspired by? </strong>

			<a href="http://www.les-ernest.fr/">Les Ernest</a> <strong>&</strong> <a href="http://chilli.be/en">Chilli</a>
		</p>

			<strong>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</strong>
		</h1>

		<p>
			<strong>Les Ernest</strong> The design utilizes a grid layout which arranges the content in columns, evenly distributing it across the screen. It is more content heavy than my other pick but the way in which the content is lined up helps the user move through the page. Colors are used to create emphasis. At the top left side of the page what seems to be a logo draws in your attention because of it's bright color and animated properties, everything else is static and much of it is black or a muted blue. On the left side is a video, this video is another area that draws your attention. 
			<br><br>This site is one that doen't use one specific focal point, but rather many content teasers with heiarchy found in each specific area. The headings are red like the logo which creates cohesion through the site. This creates balance allowing your eyes to flow over the content without being overpowered by too much of such a bold color. There is a side bar that creates a call for action, I'm not sure what this is because I don't speak French. The rest of the site scrolls down while this area stays in place. This to me is a thoughtful use of space. 
			<br><br>This site is reporting some type of information. The biggest story takes up a large singular space that is then split into 5 columns of space as we travel below the fold, displaying stories of lesser importance. This emphasizes one story in particular and uses the space in a neat, balanced way, creating a hierarchy and making the stories easy to browse through which seems to be the point of the site.

			<strong>Chilli</strong> A minimal, well balanced site, that uses the space very effectivley. This design uses a grid layout to display it's content. The content is made up of teasers for different projects the design firm undertook. I'd say a focal point here is the logo, although it doesn't scream loudly, the space surrounding it and the larger font size it boasts in comparison to the navigation area draw my attention to it first. The rectangular space below it draws me in as well because it is a darker color than the surrounding rectangles. 
			<br><br>The three columns maintain a nice balance. The image in the center column is an attention grabbing area, but the two tone blocks on either side of it that it lacks, with its bare white background, balance it out so your eye doesn't get stuck there. There is a cohesiveness in the minimal choice of grey scale. The beautiful typography, and color pops that appear through the hovering of the mouse add a little spice the the minimalism.

			<strong>What makes them similar and different?</strong>
		</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Similarity</strong> Common use of a grid system to create balance in the space. Both are effective sites for their purpose. Both align the logo on the left. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Difference</strong> Les Ernest leaves less white space overall while Chilli leaves more breathing room particularlt at the top and surrounding it's content. Chilli is more minimal, barely using color. Les Ernest doesn't use much variety in color but uses color through out to create emphasis in certain areas. Les Ernest's site has a call for action while Chilli doesn't. Although Les Ernest appears a bit more chaotic than Chilli on the scale from organized <-------> chaotic, it still allows you to browse over the videos effectivley.

			<li><strong>Les Ernest</strong>
			<br> <strong>Focal Point</strong> No one focal point, instead many content teasers that demonstrate hierarchy within. Color is used to create areas of emphasis as well as size. As you click on videos they are enlarged to keep the viewers attention focused on what they are viewing.
			<br><strong>Hierarchy</strong> Size creates hierarchy dictating what draws your attention in first. Color also plays a role in this. Titles and the logo use color, against the muted tones they stand out and have emphasis.
			<br><strong>Balance</strong> Composition is balanced through it's grid like structure, the visual weight is evenly distributed and aligned in rows.</li>

			<br>
			<li><strong>Chilli</strong>
			<br><strong>Focal Point</strong> Chilli's focal point is the area its logo is placed in and the black box beneath that illustrates it's mission statement.
			<br><strong>Hierarchy</strong> My eye is drawn at first to the bold yet minimal logo since I read from left to right and top to bottom. The space surrounding it and its larger font size than the nav bar create hierarchy. Yet the bold black square right below it explaining "Chilli" is also emphasized. From here my eye flows through the rest of the content. Thin thick text combinations also create hierarchy.
			<br> <strong>Balance</strong> is created through three symetrical rows of content housed in rectangle shapes. Above the fold we see a central white rectanble that doesn't carry as much weight as the rectangles on either side, but the high contrast photo within it makes up for this. The visual weight is evenly distributed.
